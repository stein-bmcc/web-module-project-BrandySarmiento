        <p1> Basketball is a sport where you need to score hoops
            with a basketball, meanwhile an opponent is going to try
            to score hoops as well and each opponent need to prevent 
            eachother from scoring hoops by taking the ball alway from them or blocking their shots.
            In this game points are counted by the distance you shoot the ball from so
            if you shoot the ball withing the big line then that would be a 1 point shot,
            if they shoot from the line or behind the 3 point line and make the shot 
            then they get 3 points. People play this sport competitively too in a thing called
            the NBA and to this day have matches between plenty of teams that all fight to be the 
            #1 team in the world of basketball. There are also these things called
            "Foul Play" that comes into lay when someone from an oppposing team injures or plays
            too rough causing the other person to either get hurt or worse, these foul plays are put 
            in place to punish those who play rough and gives the person who got injured by a foul play
            a free shot/foul shot which they can take from the one point line.
