       <p1> In Soccer the aim of the game is to try and get a soccer ball into the goal net
        while the other team tries to score in your sides goal net, There is always a Goalie who 
        can use their whole body to stop the other team from scoring a goal by blocking the ball with their
        hands, feet, and their whole body, and they can't really 
        go out into the field the goalie is the protector of the goal that needs to make sure the 
        ball doesn't go in the goal net. Players out in the field can not let the ball touch their hand
        they will be met with a punishment causing the opposing team to have the ball. If someone kicks,
        hits or plays too rough and gets an opposing person from the opposing team injured the referee of 
        the match decides how bad the person who caused the foul play should be punished by giving them a yellow card
        or a Red card. The yellow card in most cases is just a warning and the opposing teammate who got hurt gets a free
        penalty shot, if the referee decides that the person who did the foul play was too bad they will recive a Red card 
        which in most cases has that player sit out for the rest of the game. A soccer match is ussually 90 minuts and if both teams 
        tie they go into over time and if they still are tied after over time they go into penalty shots, the 2 teams then play for 
        who makes the most penalty shots, each team has 5 shots and the team who makes the most out of the 5 penalty shots comes out 
        with the victory at the end.
