        than the other team. The offense tries to move 
        the ball down the field and score points in the 
        opposing team's end zone. The defense tries to 
        stop the offense from scoring and regain possession
         of the ball. When scoring, A touchdown is worth six 
         points, and a field goal is worth three points.

         point or pass or run for two extra points. when tackling
